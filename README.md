# Etherpad-Lite Heroku

Deploy Etherpad-Lite on Heroku. Whole Etherpad-Lite configuration, including plugins, can be specified in Heroku configuration variables (ENV).

## Running

### Cloning

As the project has Etherpad as submodule, you need to clone it with `--recursive` flag:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/citizenos/etherpad-lite-heroku.git`

### Configuration

Configuration can be specified in 2 ways:

* File (`config/local.json`) - designed for development environments where file configuration is simpler to maintain than env variables. See the example [local.json](config/local.json.example)
* Environment variables - this is where all Heroku configuration variables show up.

**NOTE:** Environment variables override `config/local.json`.

#### Etherpad-Lite configuration variables

In Heroku config variables (ENV):

* `ETHERPAD_SETTINGS` - JSON string of the whole standard Etherpad-Lite `settings.json`.
* `ETHERPAD_SESSION_KEY` - The secret stored in Etherpad-Lite `SESSIONKEY.txt`.
* `ETHERPAD_API_KEY` - The secret stored in Etherpad-Lite `APIKEY.txt`.
* `DATABASE_URL` - Default database URI environment variable set by Heroku. It overrides all other DB configurations.

JSON defined in `ETHERPAD_SETTINGS` or `config/local.json`:

* `___apiKey` - The secret stored in Etherpad-Lite `APIKEY.txt`.
* `___sessionKey` - The secret stored in Etherpad-Lite `SESSIONKEY.txt`.
* `___version` - Per plugin configuration. Version of plugin to be installed by NPM.

#### Plugin configuration

Plugin version and configuration can be specified. Plugins are configured as you would normally do in Etherpad-Lite `settings.json`, but you can also specify plugin version which will be installed by NPM.

* `___version` - version of the plugin to be installed.

Example plugin config in `ETHERPAD_SETTINGS` or `config/local.json`:

```
  "ep_themes_ext": {
    "___version": "0.0.4",
    "default": [
      "https://dev.citizenos.com:3001/static/styles/etherpad.css"
    ]
  }
```
#### Etherpad-Lite Heroku specific conf

* `ETHERPAD_LITE_HEROKU_LOGGER_LEVEL` - Logging level for the [start.js](start.js) script.

### Run

#### Heroku

Push it to your Heroku and Heroku will just run it picking up the entry point from [Procfile](Procfile)

#### Locally

After first checkout:

* Run: `git submodule init && git submodule update` - this will update Etherpad submodule

To run the app:

* `npm run start-dev`

**NOTE:** When running locally with Citizen OS API, you may run into issues with certificate chain validation because of the API calls. In that case for **DEV ONLY** you can turn off the validation starting the app `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 npm run start-dev`.
**NOTE2:** DO NOT commit the generated `package.json`. If generated plugin configuration is in the `package.json` `/config/` has no effect.

## Development notes

* While Etherpad runs, it takes the plugin code from `./etherpad-lite/node_modules`.

## Credits

* This project started as a fork of https://github.com/bright-star/etherpad-lite-heroku and basic concepts are borrowed from there.
